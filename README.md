# Crazy Eights

I built this app while learning how to code at [The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org). I originally developed it as a python command line game, but eventually converted it to JavaScript and added a GUI with html and css. This is the first game I created where the user plays against the computer.
  
For rules on how to play Crazy Eights, visit the official rules at [Bicycle](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/crazy-eights/).
  
To play, click and drag a card from your hand onto the discard pile. Or, click on the deck to draw a card into your hand if you can't discard one. If the computer plays an 8 (a wild card), look at the suit symbol next to the discard pile to determine what suit must be followed. If you play an 8, you'll be prompted to select a suit.
  
Once either you or the computer wins, a scorecard will be displayed, giving you the option of continuing with another hand. To reset the game and start over, reload the page.
